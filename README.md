# Welcome!
This is the code repository for Break my Bones, a Minecraft 1.18.2 mod that adds a variety of weapons to the game.

## General Info
Break My Bones is a mod that adds a large variety of weapons to choose from. From daggers to bo staffs, all the weapons have as much variety as I could give them!

This mod uses Json Things (to register all the items for the mod) and Better Combat (provides the unique attack patterns that will spice up combat!) to allow for a nice mod that I can easily work and continue to improve on! The weapons also appear as 16x16 in the inventory, but when held appear as 32x32; meaning items are not huge in the inventory or appear as a very low resolution.

## How to Compile from GitHub
1. Click the button that says `<> Code`.
